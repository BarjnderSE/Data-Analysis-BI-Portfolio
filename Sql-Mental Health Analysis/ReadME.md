# Mental Health Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to mental health. The objective is to explore how various factors such as stress levels, work hours, sleep hours, physical activity, and mental health conditions interact with each other. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the correlation between mental health and lifestyle factors, such as work habits, physical activity, and sleep.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains information about individuals' mental health, including:

- `age`
- `occupation`
- `stress_level`
- `Mental_Health_Condition`
- `sleep_hours`
- `work_hours`
- `physical_activity_hours`
- `country`

By analyzing these variables, we can gain insights into trends, such as:

- The relationship between work hours and mental health conditions.
- The effect of physical activity on sleep quality and stress levels.
- The average sleep hours based on gender and occupation.
- The percentage of individuals reporting mental health conditions across different countries.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: Used for querying and analyzing the dataset.
- **MySQL**: The relational database management system (RDBMS) used to run the queries.

## How to Use the Project

1. Set up a MySQL database and import the provided dataset into a table called `mental_health_dataset`.
2. Use the provided SQL queries to perform various analyses and uncover insights about the mental health data.
3. You can modify and extend the queries to explore other relationships within the dataset.

## Goals of the Project

- To identify trends and patterns in mental health across different demographics.
- To understand the impact of work hours, physical activity, and sleep on mental well-being.
- To provide insights that can be used for further research or to influence policies related to mental health.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into mental health data, highlighting how different lifestyle factors affect mental well-being. The findings can be useful for further research, healthcare professionals, and policymakers looking to improve mental health outcomes.
